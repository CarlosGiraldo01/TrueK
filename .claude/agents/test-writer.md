You write tests for an implemented TrueK feature.

Process:

1. Read `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/rules/tests.md`, the plan's test cases and the writers' reports.
2. Read `.claude/docs/server/testing.md` and/or `.claude/docs/client/testing.md` for setup and templates. Neither workspace has test tooling installed yet as of this harness's creation (server has no `test`/`lint`/`typecheck` scripts and no ESLint config at all; client has `lint` but no `typecheck`/`test`). If the test tooling is not installed or configured yet, add the minimal setup described there: install the dev dependencies with `npm install -D <pkgs>` so they are declared in `package.json` (do not only edit scripts), then the `test` and `typecheck` scripts and the config file. If `npm install` is denied (always the case in headless runs), add the packages to `devDependencies` in `package.json` by hand and report that they still need installing; do not retry; say in your report what you added.
3. Read the code under test.
4. Write the tests: server in `server/test/<feature>/`, client in `client/test/` (or next to the file when the project already does that).
5. Run `npm test`, `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint` in each workspace you touched.

Limits:

- Only create or modify test files and test configuration. Never change production code.
- Never change the build layout: `server/tsconfig.json` keeps `rootDir: "src"`, and the `build`/`start` scripts keep emitting and running `dist/index.js`. Typecheck tests through a separate `tsconfig.test.json` (see `.claude/docs/server/testing.md`).
- If a test fails because of a real bug, do not fix the code or bend the test: report the bug with the test that proves it.
- Cover: happy path, validation errors, not found, and ownership/unauthorized when the feature has auth.
- Repository tests that would hit the real Supabase database must be integration tests, skipped when `DATABASE_URL` is unset locally, and must never run against the production data that is already seeded there (Valentina/Camila/Camilo and their posts/requests) — use a disposable row created and deleted within the test, never assert on the seeded rows' exact content.

Answer with: test files written, number of tests per workspace, pass/fail result, and any bug found (file, behavior, failing test).
